# 2‑Hour Challenge — Zoho Books Paid Invoice Collector

Invite‑only. We offer this only to the top 1–5% of candidates. If you clearly succeed, you have ~90% odds of receiving an offer (subject to standard checks). Compensation: Flat $50 for this 2‑hour exercise.

# Goal
Create a browser-based automation agent (no API usage) that collects a list of invoices from Zoho Books Demo Company and saves them into a CSV file.
Required steps: Go to [Zoho Books Demo Dashboard](https://www.zoho.com/books/accounting-software-demo/#/home/dashboard).

In the navigation, click **Sales** → **Invoices**.

Collect the list of all invoices that have status **Paid** or **Partially Paid**.

Store this list into a CSV file with the following columns:

- invoice_id
- customer
- amount
- paid_at
- status

# Timebox
**Hard cap:** 2 hours from the moment you start reading/spec’ing to final delivery. You may pre‑install dependencies before starting the timer.

# Deliverables
**Repo link** with a short README (≤200 words) explaining how to run the script.

**Short Loom** (≤3 minutes) showing: navigating to Zoho Books Demo and opening the Invoices page, the browser agent collecting only Paid and Partially Paid invoices, the CSV file with correct columns and data.

**Time proof:** a screenshot of your timer in a /timeproof folder with total minutes noted.

**LLM leverage:** a /prompts.md with 3–5 prompts you used and how each helped.


# Success criteria
**Accurate filtering:** only Paid or Partially Paid invoices are collected.

**Data completeness:** CSV has all required columns populated.

**Easy to run:** minimal setup, works from scratch.

**Timebox honored** and **LLM leverage evident**.
